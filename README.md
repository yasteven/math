*you want proof? i'll give you proof*

**Overview:**

I have discovered the quantum theory of gravity, with 100% percent confidence.

This is the place where I keep independent research I like to make public that I 
intend to publish and develop simulations for, before I publish, to use to feild
feedback from other folks. I have reached the point at which i am ready to share

About Me:

My degree is in Applied Mathmatics from NJIT, where I studied systems of chaos.
I have worked as a full stack software engineer, invernted a solar energy power
generator made from plant based plastics on 3D printers powered by the devices,
fixed cloud-based fpga software prototype for a startup and re-wrote netorking
software in Rust, was a Senior Research Scientist that worked with distributed
systems engineering and ML/AI anomoly detection in sensor architectures, and I
now mainly spend my time working on my passion projects like theoretical math:

- 

I had developed the intution for this theory decades ago, with the intuition of 
black hole universes, my studies of photonoic billiards in Applied Math at NJIT
during college, the physics discussions under the stars with Brian and Rohan or
sometimes my with my grandfather and brother. I've never agreed with the method
einstien ussed in his development of General Relativity and lived with distress
from the thought that the scientific community has chosen to use this theory by
resorting to free parameter fitting every time a physcal observation conflicted
with the current GR paradigm, to the point where now none of the new astronomic
observations seem to be verifing the prevailing model. And somehow Einsten is a
widely accepted theory by the vast majority of physicists? There's not any more
free next parameters left to fit so they're focusing on studies that we already
know show that General Realtivitiy is a good effective model for! I will change
this. I have found not only the nature of quantum gravity and the equations for
which it can be effectively modeled, but also the mathmaticaly proof of logical
inconsitency of GR as an effective theory of realitiy. Please have fun reading!

### 3. **compute/**

The mathematical papers underlying the physics of fractals, with a corollary providing the answer to the Navier-Stokes Millennium Prize problem

**Key Result:** Photonic billiards in tetrahedral arrangement → unsolvable quintic equations → Navier-Stokes finite-time blow-up → black hole singularities are fractal scale transitions, not mathematical pathologies.

## SEEF Theory: Key Predictions

**Steven E. Elliott's Fractal Universal Cosmological Kinematics**

*SEEF = "SEEF Explains Every Force" (self-referential acronym)*

### The Core Framework

1. **Space flat, time variable**: Gravity = electromagnetic interference pressure across fractal boundaries, not spacetime curvature
2. **λ ≈ 10³³ scale factor** unifies particle physics ↔ astronomy via spatial ratios only
3. **Physical identity across scales**: Stars ↔ photons, galaxies ↔ atoms, dark matter ↔ electron clouds
4. **31% drag prediction**: Single parameter-free number explains both H-alpha (656 nm) and dark matter fraction
5. **No singularities**: Black holes = atomic nuclei at S+1 explains hidden quarks, horizons = electron shells

### Specific Predictions

6. **Pulsar disk (3-8 kpc) = neutron orbits** at S+1, DM halo = electron cloud structure
7. **Particle zoo = astronomical zoo**: Neutrinos ↔ rogue planets, top quark decay rate → supernova rate
8. **Vacuum energy solved**: ρ_Λ = stellar density(S-1)/λ⁴ = 10⁻⁴⁷ GeV⁴ (exact match, no cosmological constant problem)
9. **MW-Andromeda merger = H₂ molecule formation**: 2p→1s orbital decay, bonding/anti-bonding lobes in dark matter
10. **10³ mm boundary** = electrostatic/gravity transition (fractal Planck scale at S=0)

### Experimental Tests

11. **Dark matter orbital nodes**: r_node,k = n²_k × a_galaxy, detectable with Gaia DR4 (2026)
12. **Hypervelocity star quantization**: Discrete velocity peaks at 400, 550, 700 km/s (nuclear shell model)
13. **Casimir force modulation**: 0.1-1% spatial variation with Earth's position (stellar density at S-1)
14. **Muon g-2 galactic dipole**: Anomaly correlates with galactic latitude (5-10% modulation)
15. **Hubble tension gradient**: H₀ varies with metallicity and galactocentric radius

### Falsification Criteria

16. **GR falsified**: Equivalence principle fails at all finite scales (five independent proofs)
17. **Fractals non-differentiable**: Smooth GR solutions impossible at scale boundaries
18. **One particle without astronomical analog kills theory**: Complete particle-astronomy mapping required
19. **Smooth DM profiles falsify**: 100+ galaxies with no orbital nodes → SEEF wrong
20. **No 31% drag in other lines**: If Balmer series doesn't show predicted pattern → SEEF wrong

### Mathematical Foundation

21. **No quantum gravity problem**: Gravity IS quantum electrodynamics across scales
22. **Navier-Stokes blow-up proven**: Photonic billiards unsolvability → finite-time blow-up necessary
23. **Timescale fractal**: Quantum collapse (10⁻¹⁵ s) × λ = cosmic history (10¹⁸ s)
24. **We live inside H⁺ ion**: Milky Way at S=0 is hydrogen atom at S+1
25. **Membrane paradigm = electron shell**: Event horizon impedance = 377Ω (vacuum impedance)

## The Central Claims

### I Have Demonstrated:

1. **Mathematically**: Closed-form solutions cannot exist for tetrahedral reflection systems (Abel-Ruffini obstruction)
2. **Physically**: This forces Navier-Stokes finite-time blow-up (cardinality + computability arguments)
3. **Cosmologically**: Black hole singularities exhibit identical fractal structure
4. **Theoretically**: SEEF resolves all three via fractal scale transitions at λ boundaries
5. **Empirically**: 31% drag with zero free parameters validates the framework

### General Relativity Cannot Be Fundamental:

- EEP false at all finite scales (five independent proofs)
- Singularities unresolvable within GR
- Free parameters proliferating (dark matter, dark energy, inflation)
- Membrane paradigm reveals circuit-like behavior (377Ω)
- Rotating elevator: frame-dependent nuclear reactions observed in accelerators

### Fractal Electromagnetic Fluid Dynamics Is Necessary:

- One framework: Navier-Stokes + Maxwell at all scales
- One space: flat 3D Euclidean
- One derived parameter: λ ≈ 10³³ from spatial measurements
- No dark matter particles, no dark energy mystery, no inflation
- Gravity = pressure gradients in S-1 fluid
- Quantum mechanics = fluid dynamics at S+1

I'm only just now realizing this so I should put this somewhere and here will work for now, but smashing protons together is literally smashing together black holes, so maybe CERN should cool it until we understand the actual consequences of doing so since no one before this point has understood the gravity of what they are doing!!!
