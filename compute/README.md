Here I am writing the fundamental fractal ball math papers:

Using the light-ray billiard system, I show:

0) Proof that all possible turing machines are enumerated in the system as ray trajectories 


    Koons Machine: A turing machine with a finite tape
    Turing Machine: A traditional turing machine  
    Edward Machine: A turing machine with tape initalized by the oracle with a number from Q m(Q)=A0 
    Elliott Machine: A blob of Edward machines (a element in the set of all subsets of edward macines) with tape initalized by the oracle with a number from C = 2^A0 
    
    C->C is the set of all functions, cardnamity > 2^A0, ~ 2^2^A0.

    Conisder the finite faces

1) Proof that the system has no closed forms due to (0) => boundary is non-computable

2) Proof that (1) => system is a one-way function

3) Proof (2) holds in the limit.

4) (2) => P != NP ; (3) => Navier Stokes non-existence 

This is just the workspace; Final papers will be put in the ../../math/ root
