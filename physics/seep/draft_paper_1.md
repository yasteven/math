# Stochastic Electrodynamic Emergence (SEE):  
## A Static-Foam, Thermodynamic Alternative to Expanding-Space Cosmology

**Author:** [Steven E. Elliott]  
**Date:** January 2026  

***

## Abstract

I propose a non-expanding, Minkowski-background cosmology in which cosmological redshift, apparent galaxy evolution, and gravitational phenomena arise from **Stochastic Electrodynamic Emergence (SEE)** rather than from a dynamical spacetime metric. In SEE, matter is distributed in a foam-like network of galaxies and clusters embedded in an effectively static spatial grid. Photons and gravitational signals propagate as point-like rays that undergo a **stochastic sequence of weak electrodynamic and gravitational interactions** with this foam, executing a random walk in both direction and energy. Redshift is reinterpreted as a measure of **path entropy** accumulated along this walk, not as a direct measure of metric expansion.  

This framework provides unified qualitative resolutions to several tensions:  
(1) the **angular diameter behavior** of high-redshift galaxies, which remain extremely compact rather than exhibiting the strong size turn-around predicted by FLRW geometry;  
(2) the presence of **“mature” massive galaxies at high redshift**, which appear overgrown relative to ΛCDM structure-formation timescales;  
(3) the observed **CMB–galaxy and CMB–void correlations**, usually attributed to the Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect; and  
(4) the nature of the **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**, reinterpreted here as a **Radio Ghost**: the thermalized end‑state of photons that have traversed long, high‑entropy paths through the foam and redshifted into the microwave regime.  

I also outline how gravitational-wave “ringdown” can be reinterpreted as **multipath dispersion** through the foam rather than pure quasi-normal ringing of a curved spacetime. SEE retains a Minkowski spacetime background and treats gravity, redshift, and lensing as **emergent, stochastic electrodynamic/quantum phenomena**, implying deep conceptual consequences for General Relativity and the cosmological distance ladder.

## 1. Introduction: From Metric Expansion to Stochastic Emergence

Modern cosmology is built on the ΛCDM model embedded in General Relativity (GR), with a Robertson–Walker metric describing an expanding spacetime. Redshift is interpreted as a stretching of wavelengths by this expansion, and cosmic history is reconstructed by inverting this metric relation.  

Recent observational developments, however, highlight growing tensions:  

- **Hubble tension:** Local distance-ladder measurements of \(H_0\) disagree with CMB-inferred values when interpreted within a single FLRW model.  
- **Angular-diameter behavior:** High‑redshift galaxies remain extremely compact on the sky and do not clearly show the geometric size turn-around expected in standard expanding cosmologies.  
- **“Mature” high‑z galaxies:** JWST has identified massive, chemically enriched galaxies at redshifts where ΛCDM expects only small, young proto-systems.  
- **CMB–large-scale-structure correlations:** Cross-correlations between CMB temperature anisotropies and galaxies/voids indicate a nontrivial coupling between radiation and the matter distribution on very large scales.  

These issues echo the pre-Einstein anomalies (such as Mercury’s precession), which were patched within Newtonian gravity until a new paradigm reframed them. SEE takes a similar step by:

- Retaining **Minkowski spacetime** as the kinematic background.  
- Treating **gravity, redshift, and lensing as emergent, stochastic electrodynamic/quantum phenomena** arising from propagation through a foam-like matter distribution.  
- Replacing metric expansion with **stochastic transport and entropy production** as the central organizing principle.

The rest of this paper outlines the SEE framework, shows how it qualitatively resolves several key cosmological puzzles, and highlights its conceptual consequences.

## 2. The SEE Framework

### 2.1 Minkowski Background and Foam-Like Matter

SEE assumes:

1. **Background spacetime:** The underlying spacetime is globally or piecewise Minkowski, with standard Lorentz invariance and light-cone structure. Special relativity kinematics (proper time, time dilation, invariant light speed) remains valid at the micro-level.  
2. **Matter distribution:** Matter is arranged in a **foam-like network** of galaxies, groups, and clusters, separated by large voids. The mean density is low, but the foam extends arbitrarily far, so the universe can be effectively infinite and temporally unbounded.  

There is **no global metric expansion of space**. Large-scale phenomena emerge from the interaction of fields with this structured but static background.

### 2.2 Rays as Stochastic Trajectories

Photons (and, by extension, weak-field gravitational signals) are treated as **point-like rays** propagating through this foam. Along their path they undergo:

- Many **weak gravitational and electrodynamic deflections** from mass concentrations and fields.  
- Small, cumulative **energy shifts** (redshifts) associated with these interactions.  

Over cosmological scales, a ray’s path becomes a **random walk** in direction and energy:

- The **geometric distance** and the **effective path length** diverge, with the latter depending on how many deflections occur.  
- The **redshift \(z\)** encodes the **integrated entropy of the path**: more interactions → longer effective path and more energy loss → higher \(z\).  

Two sources at the same Minkowski distance can thus have different redshifts if their rays experience different stochastic histories. Conversely, high redshift does not uniquely mean “early” in a global cosmic-time sense.

## 3. Resolving Olbers’ Paradox and Reframing Redshift

### 3.1 Olbers’ Paradox via Entropic Screening

In an infinite, static, uniformly filled universe, every line of sight should end on a star, making the night sky bright. SEE resolves this by recognizing that:

- Rays from distant stars must traverse the foam, encountering many weak deflections.  
- Each deflection alters direction and drains a small amount of energy.  
- The probability that a ray reaches us **sharp and energetic** falls rapidly with the number of deflections; most contributions from sufficiently distant sources are **thermalized** before arriving in the optical/IR band.  

Only a **small fraction of rays** from distant matter remain “lucky” enough to reach us as resolvable galaxy light. The rest contribute to a diffuse, low-energy background. The night sky is dark in the optical/IR not because the universe is finite in time, but because **most paths are entropically screened**.

### 3.2 Redshift as Path Entropy, Not Expansion

In SEE, redshift is fundamentally:

- A measure of **path entropy**: the cumulative effect of many stochastic interactions.  
- A functional of the **foam statistics along the line of sight**, not a direct indicator of metric stretching.  

This immediately reframes:

- The **Hubble law** as a **local effective law** emerging where foam statistics are simple and nearly homogeneous.  
- The **Hubble tension** as a mismatch between different effective transport regimes (local point-like rays vs long-path, nearly decoupled radiation), rather than a single underlying expansion rate.

## 4. Four Key Phenomena in SEE

### 4.1 Angular Diameter Behavior of High‑z Galaxies

In FLRW cosmology, the angular diameter distance \(d_A(z)\) is non-monotonic: beyond \(z \sim 1.5\!-\!1.6\), a standard ruler should **grow in apparent angular size** with increasing redshift. High‑z galaxies are thus expected to appear larger on the sky than ones at moderate z, for fixed physical scale, once geometric and evolutionary effects are accounted for.  

In SEE:

- The large-scale background is effectively **Euclidean**; apparent size scales approximately as inverse distance.  
- No geometric size turn-around is enforced; high‑z galaxies can remain extremely compact on the sky, consistent with a static geometry plus intrinsic size evolution.  

Current observations of very compact, small high‑z galaxies are naturally read in this static framework, without needing to invoke strong geometric magnification at large z.

### 4.2 “Lucky” Mature Galaxies at High Redshift

JWST has revealed galaxies at high redshift that appear too massive and chemically evolved for their “age” in ΛCDM. In SEE:

- The universe can be **effectively eternal**; there is no unique Big Bang age that all galaxies share.  
- High redshift signals **high path entropy**, not necessarily youth.  
- A “mature” high‑z galaxy is an **old system** whose rays have taken a particular stochastic path:  
  - “Lucky” rays: relatively straight, low-interaction trajectories that maintain a sharp, point-like image and arrive with finite \(z\).  
  - “Unlucky” rays: heavily scattered, redshifted into the background and effectively lost to direct imaging.  

Thus, the “impossibly early” massive galaxies in ΛCDM become **ordinary old galaxies** in SEE, viewed through specific transport channels in the foam.

### 4.3 CMB–Galaxy / Void Correlation and the “Radio Ghost”

The CMB shows temperature anisotropies that correlate with the distribution of galaxies and voids, interpreted in ΛCDM as the Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect. In SEE:

- Photons that have undergone extremely long and complex random walks can be **redshifted down into the microwave regime**.  
- At these wavelengths, typical structures in the foam are much smaller than the wavelength, so scattering and absorption cross-sections become small; photons effectively **decouple from matter** and propagate as a diffuse background.  
- This background is the **Radio Ghost**: a thermalized equilibrium field of over-redshifted photons filling the static grid.  

Residual correlations with the matter distribution arise because:

- The **final stages** of energy exchange between radiation and the foam still imprint subtle temperature modulations.  
- Dense or under-dense regions slightly alter the last steps of the random walk, leaving cold or hot spots in the Radio Ghost.  

The CMB thus encodes the **thermodynamic history of radiation transport** through the foam rather than exclusively a one-time relic of a hot initial state.

### 4.4 Gravitational-Wave “Ringdown” as Multipath Dispersion

In GR, gravitational-wave ringdown is a quasi-normal mode ringing of the remnant black hole. In SEE:

- The merger event produces a **coherent pulse** in the underlying matter–field system.  
- As this pulse propagates through the foam, different portions of the disturbance follow **slightly different stochastic paths**, experiencing different effective delays and energy losses.  
- The initially sharp chirp becomes **temporally smeared**:  
  - Early-time signal = near-straight, low-entropy paths.  
  - Late-time “ringdown tail” = high-entropy, longer, more scattered paths of the same underlying disturbance.  

Subtle deviations from pure quasi-normal GR ringdowns, especially distance-dependent dispersion or microstructure in the tail, would be natural signatures of SEE.

## 5. Infinite Mass, Light Cones, and Apparent Cosmic Repulsion

In SEE, the universe is effectively infinite in spatial extent and filled with a low-density but unbounded foam of matter. For any observer, a finite past light cone encloses only a small portion of the total matter; the majority of mass lies **outside** that light cone. This connects directly to the classical **Seeliger paradox** in Newtonian gravity, where the gravitational influence of an infinite homogeneous mass distribution becomes ill-defined.  

### 5.1 Seeliger’s Paradox as a Stochastic Field

Seeliger showed that in an infinite, homogeneous Newtonian universe, the net gravitational force on a test mass cannot be defined unambiguously by summing \(1/r^2\) contributions from all directions: rearranging the infinite mass leads to different results. Traditionally this motivated modifying gravity or introducing new cosmologies.  

SEE reinterprets this as:

- The “undefined” net force from infinity is a sign that the **influence of distant mass is intrinsically stochastic**, not a single clean vector.  
- The effective gravitational field from the rest of the universe is a **random, slowly fluctuating drift field**, whose direction and magnitude vary as the large-scale mass distribution evolves.

### 5.2 Worldlines as Random Walks in an Infinite Foam

In SEE:

- Both **matter** and **radiation** worldlines experience a **random-walk drift** under the influence of the fluctuating external mass distribution.  
- Because there is vastly more mass outside any finite region than inside, trajectories tend to **diffuse away from their earlier positions** in configuration space.  
- This diffusion is **biased outward**: the dominant gravitational contribution effectively acts like a weak, large-scale “pull” into the rest of the infinite cosmos, even though the universe has no true edge or center.  

The situation is loosely analogous to the **hairy ball theorem**: you cannot define a smooth, nonzero tangent vector field everywhere on a sphere without singularities. Likewise, in an infinite, statistically inhomogeneous mass distribution, there is no globally defined, exactly canceling gravitational field; there are always directions where the net field points slightly “outward.”

### 5.3 Apparent Expansion and Local Redshift

This biased random walk has two main observational consequences:

1. **Apparent cosmic repulsion / Hubble flow**  
   - Our local frame is not sitting in a perfectly balanced potential; it is **slowly drifting** relative to the external mass.  
   - Nearby galaxies, embedded in the same foam, show **relative motions** that resemble mutual recession when interpreted through a purely geometric lens.  
   - What we call “expansion” is, in SEE, the **macroscopic projection of Seeliger-driven diffusion** in an infinite mass field.

2. **Local redshift in the foam**  
   - Photons from nearby galaxies still undergo **biased random walks**: small cumulative energy losses plus frame drift yield a **local redshift–distance relation**.  
   - So the fact that we see a Hubble-like redshift even in the local foam arises not from local metric expansion, but from **outward-diffusive drift plus electrodynamic energy loss** in SEE.

## 6. SEE and the Cosmological Distance Ladder

The traditional cosmological distance ladder assumes:

- A unique **redshift–distance relation** derived from an FRW metric.  
- Light propagating along **geodesics in a smooth metric**, with lensing as a small perturbation.  
- A single global Hubble parameter \(H_0\) consistently connecting local and CMB scales.  

In SEE:

- **Redshift is not uniquely tied to distance**; it is a stochastic functional of the foam along the path.  
- The **Hubble law** is at best a **local effective relation** in regimes where foam statistics are simple and nearly homogeneous.  
- Different observational channels (local standard candles vs CMB) probe **different transport regimes** (short-path point-like rays vs long-path Radio Ghost), leading to inherently different effective \(H_0\) estimates.  

The “distance ladder” becomes a **transport ladder**:

- Each rung must be calibrated not only by intrinsic source properties and Minkowski geometry, but also by an assumed model for **stochastic interactions with the foam**.  
- The Hubble tension is reinterpreted as evidence that we are combining incompatible transport regimes into a single geometric law.

## 7. Time Dilation, Electrodynamics, Quantum Effects, and Emergent Gravity

SEE is also a program for reinterpreting gravity itself.

### 7.1 Minkowski Baseline and Dynamical Time

Rather than starting from a dynamical spacetime metric, SEE starts with **Minkowski spacetime**:

- The light cone, Lorentz invariance, and special-relativistic time dilation are fundamental kinematics.  
- Proper time is still defined along worldlines, but the **rates of physical processes** (clocks, transitions, phases) can depend on the surrounding matter–field configuration.

What is usually called “gravitational time dilation” is reinterpreted as:

- A **dynamical slowing of internal processes** induced by interaction with the foam (via potentials, field configurations, vacuum effects), not as a direct manifestation of curvature.

### 7.2 Electrodynamic and Quantum Substrate

In SEE, **gravity-like behavior** emerges from:

- The way **electromagnetic and other gauge fields** respond to the distribution of mass–energy, altering effective refractive indices for light and matter waves.  
- The way **quantum phases** accumulate in different environments, creating effective potentials and preferred trajectories for wave packets.  

Free fall, redshift, and lensing arise as **collective, emergent behavior** of particles and fields in Minkowski spacetime, moving through a structured foam and undergoing stochastic interactions. The **Equivalence Principle** becomes:

- An **approximate emergent symmetry** that holds when the foam is homogeneous on relevant scales and when quantum/electromagnetic microstructure is coarse-grained.  
- Potentially **violated in subtle ways** when composition, quantum state, or field configurations differ, opening the door to small but meaningful EP violations.

In a separate work, I present thought experiments that illustrate how time dilation, electromagnetic structure, and quantum effects can generate gravity-like phenomena and small departures from exact equivalence, supporting the view that GR’s geometric gravity is an effective, large-scale description rather than fundamental.

Under SEE, GR is reinterpreted as a **remarkably successful effective field theory** describing the coarse-grained behavior of this emergent gravity in many regimes, but it is not fundamental. The metric appears curved because clocks and rulers built from matter respond differently to the foam, not because spacetime itself is literally curved as a fundamental field.

## 8. Observational Status and Falsifiable Predictions

SEE must ultimately be judged against data. It is not yet a full quantitative competitor to ΛCDM/GR, but it makes distinctive qualitative and semi-quantitative predictions:

1. **Angular Diameter vs Redshift**  
   - No mandatory non-monotonic size turn-around; high‑z galaxies can remain compact on the sky.  
   - Detailed size–redshift trends encode both intrinsic evolution and foam statistics, not just FRW geometry.

2. **Surface Brightness and Tolman-like Tests**  
   - Surface brightness dimming arises from both energy loss and angular dispersion driven by stochastic interactions.  
   - The scaling with redshift need not equal the \((1+z)^{-4}\) of pure expanding-universe Tolman law and should instead be derived from a concrete SEE transport model.

3. **Demographics of High‑z “Mature” Galaxies**  
   - SEE expects a **broad age distribution at all redshifts**; high‑z massive systems are not paradoxical.  
   - Structural/dynamical age indicators should show **weak correlation** with FLRW lookback time when reanalyzed without assuming expansion.

4. **CMB Power and Cross-Correlations**  
   - The CMB spectrum and anisotropies reflect the **equilibrium state of the Radio Ghost** plus residual coupling to foam structure.  
   - Cross-correlations with galaxies/voids are expected, but interpreted as late-stage thermodynamic effects, not purely as signatures of accelerating expansion.

5. **Gravitational-Wave Ringdown Microstructure**  
   - High-precision ringdown observations could reveal **distance- and environment-dependent dispersion or fine structure** reflecting multipath propagation through the foam, beyond the pure GR quasi-normal mode template.

***

## 9. Conclusion

Stochastic Electrodynamic Emergence (SEE) offers a radically different organizing principle for cosmology and gravity:

- **Spacetime**: Minkowski background, not dynamically curved.  
- **Gravity and redshift**: Emergent from **stochastic electrodynamic and quantum interactions** with a foam-like matter distribution.  
- **CMB**: A **Radio Ghost**, the thermalized end-state of long-path photons, not uniquely a relic of a hot Big Bang.  
- **Distance and expansion**: Redshift is path entropy, not guaranteed evidence of metric expansion.  

By reframing anomalies such as the angular diameter behavior of high‑z galaxies, the presence of “mature” high‑z systems, the CMB–galaxy/void correlations, the Seeliger paradox, and the Hubble tension in terms of stochastic transport and emergence, SEE opens a coherent alternative to ΛCDM/GR.  

The next steps are clear: formulate explicit stochastic transport equations in a Minkowski background, perform ray‑tracing through realistic foam simulations, and confront SEE predictions with the full suite of cosmological data. Whether or not SEE is ultimately correct, it exemplifies the kind of **radical alternative** that a paradigm in crisis demands.
