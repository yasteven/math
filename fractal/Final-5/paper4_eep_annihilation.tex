\title{SEEF Explains Einstein's Falsehood: \\
       \large Why the Equivalence Principle Requires Fractal Physics}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We present five independent demonstrations that Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) fails at all finite scales, establishing that gravitational freefall is always distinguishable from uniform acceleration. These include: (1) finite-time and finite-space distinguishability in an effectively infinite universe, (2) increasing measurement precision making tidal forces more observable at smaller scales, (3) frame-dependent nuclear reactions and radiation in the charged particle / nuclear elevator paradox, (4) the mathematical discontinuity in GR requiring EEP to hold only at the unphysical zero-size limit, and (5) how GR's attempts to resolve charged-particle paradoxes (distorted fields, horizons, membrane paradigm) inadvertently support a fractal electromagnetic fluid picture over geometric gravity. This foundational failure cannot be resolved within General Relativity, necessitating a replacement framework. We demonstrate that SEEF (SEEF Explains Every Force) provides the natural alternative, with gravity emerging from electromagnetic fluid pressure gradients and scale transitions explicitly incorporated via environment-dependent fractal structure. The implications are profound: General Relativity cannot be fundamental, gravity is not geometric, and fractal physics is physically required.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The Equivalence Principle as Foundation}
Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) states:
\begin{center}
\textit{A uniformly accelerating reference frame is locally indistinguishable \\
from a uniform gravitational field.}
\end{center}
This principle serves as the cornerstone of General Relativity. If EEP is demonstrably false at all physical scales, GR's geometrical interpretation of gravity cannot be fundamental.
\subsection{The SEEF Context}
This paper is the fourth in the SEEF series:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Paper 1:} SEEF Explains Every Force (theoretical foundation, 31\% drag)
    \item \textbf{Paper 2:} SEEF Explains Every Fit (empirical evidence)
    \item \textbf{Paper 3:} SEEF Enumerates Every Forecast (experimental predictions)
    \item \textbf{Paper 4:} SEEF Explains Einstein's Falsehood (this paper—EEP critique)
    \item \textbf{Paper 5:} SEEF Explores Embedded Facts (philosophical implications)
\end{itemize}
We demonstrate that EEP's failure necessitates fractal electromagnetic fluid dynamics as the replacement framework.

\section{Five Independent Proofs Against EEP}
\subsection{Argument 1: Finite-Time and Finite-Space Distinguishability}
\subsubsection{Einstein's Thought Experiment}
You wake up floating in an elevator. Einstein asks: ``Are you in freefall or floating in deep space?''
\textbf{Einstein's claim:}
\begin{quote}
``You cannot distinguish them locally. You might wait forever.''
\end{quote}
\subsubsection{The Finite-Time Refutation}
Uniform acceleration leads to a Rindler horizon after finite proper time, beyond which signals cannot reach the observer, distinguishing it from indefinite gravitational freefall \cite{Rindler1960,RindlerHorizonEgan}.
\textbf{Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{If gravitational freefall:} Will eventually hit ground (finite time $t_{\text{fall}}$)
    \item \textbf{If uniform acceleration:} Must transition after time $t = c/a$ (SR prevents $v > c$)
    \item \textbf{If standing on planet:} Can remain at surface indefinitely without SR violation
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Finite distinguishing time:}
\begin{equation}
t_{\text{max}} = \frac{c}{a} \approx \frac{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{10 \text{ m/s}^2} \approx 3 \times 10^7 \text{ s} \approx 1 \text{ year}
\label{eq:finite_time}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{The Finite-Space Critique in an Effectively Infinite Universe}
GR claims equivalence holds in the limit $L \to 0$ (zero-size region). But in an effectively infinite spacetime, \textit{any} finite region becomes ``local'' when compared to infinity.
Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Earth-Sun distance: $1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m
    \item Galactic radius: $10^{21}$ m
    \item Observable universe: $10^{26}$ m
\end{itemize}
If $L \to 0$ is the criterion, then everything finite is ``local'' relative to cosmic scales. EEP becomes a tautology: ``Physics is locally indistinguishable everywhere because everywhere is infinitesimal compared to infinity.''
\textbf{Physical reality:} Experiments occur in finite boxes over finite times. Distinguishability must be assessed in those real regions—not in an idealized mathematical limit.
\subsubsection{The Rindler Horizon}
In uniformly accelerating coordinates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Horizon forms at distance $c^2/a$ behind observer
    \item Information from beyond horizon cannot reach the accelerating observer
    \item This causal structure is absent in true gravitational freefall
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Conclusion}
After time $t = c/a$, uniform acceleration must cease or violate SR, while standing on a planet does not. In an infinite universe, the ``local'' limit renders EEP vacuous. \textbf{Einstein's infinite-time and infinitesimal-size escapes are closed.}
\subsection{Argument 2: Tidal Forces More Observable at Small Scales}
\subsubsection{The Standard Claim}
GR asserts: ``As region size $L \to 0$, tidal forces vanish, making gravity locally indistinguishable from acceleration.''
\subsubsection{The Physical Reality}
Tidal effects persist and sharpen with precision at finite scales \cite{EPForumTidal,Schiff1960}.
Tidal gradient over region $L$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta a_{\text{tidal}} \sim \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial r^2} \cdot L
\label{eq:tidal}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Standard interpretation:} $\Delta a \propto L \to 0$ as $L \to 0$.
\textbf{But measurement precision improves:}
\begin{equation}
\text{SNR} = \frac{\Delta a}{\delta a} \propto \frac{L}{\delta a}
\label{eq:snr}
\end{equation}
Modern instruments: atomic interferometers ($\delta a \sim 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$), superconducting gravimeters ($\sim 10^{-12}$), next-gen quantum sensors ($\sim 10^{-14}$ projected). If $\delta a \propto L^{1+\epsilon}$ ($\epsilon > 0$), then SNR $\to \infty$ as $L \to 0$.
\textbf{Consequence:} Better instruments make tidal forces \textit{more} distinguishable.
\subsubsection{The Electron Field Becomes ``Pointy'' in Gravity}
In a gravitational field, the Coulomb field of a charged particle is distorted into a prolate ellipsoid (compressed downward, stretched upward), with increasing gradient at the tips \cite{Rohrlich2007}.
This is not a coordinate artifact—it is physical redistribution of field energy driven by tidal forces $\partial_i \partial_j \Phi$. To a distant observer, the ``pointy'' field appears to carry energy away, mimicking radiation-like effects.
The only way to eliminate this is a zero-size frame where no field can exist. But physics requires field extent; thus the ``local inertial frame'' cannot describe charged particles in gravity.
\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Tidal forces become sharper with precision. The ``pointy'' field distortion creates frame-dependent energy redistribution that cannot be removed by shrinking the frame. \textbf{The local limit where EEP holds does not exist physically.}
\subsection{Argument 3: The Charged Particle / Nuclear Elevator Paradox}
\subsubsection{Linear Nuclear Elevator}
\textbf{Scenario 1 (gravitational field):} Freefall in Earth's gravity $\\rightarrow$ charged particle at rest in local frame $\\rightarrow$ no radiation $\\rightarrow$ no photofission in U-235 $\\rightarrow$ no explosion.\\
\textbf{Scenario 2 (uniform acceleration in flat space):} Accelerating elevator $\\rightarrow$ charged particle accelerates $\\rightarrow$ gamma-ray emission $\\rightarrow$ photofission $\\rightarrow$ nuclear explosion.\\
\textbf{Outcome:} Explosion in one case, stability in the other—frame-dependent physical reality.
Quantification for $a \sim 10^{10}$ m/s$^2$: detectable emission in seconds, outcome in minutes.
\subsubsection{Rotating Elevator Variant}
Observer at center of rotating disk (angular velocity $\omega$), electron fixed at rim (radius $R$). Rotating observer sees electron at rest $\\rightarrow$ static Coulomb field. Inertial observer sees centripetal acceleration $a = \omega^2 R$ $\\rightarrow$ Larmor radiation:
\begin{equation}
P = \frac{\mu_0 q^2 a^2}{6\pi c} \neq 0
\label{eq:larmor}
\end{equation}
Radiation can trigger uranium photofission $\\rightarrow$ explosion in inertial frame, none in rotating frame. Ehrenfest paradox ($C \neq 2\pi R$ due to Lorentz contraction) and non-local horizon effects make rotation incompatible with purely local equivalence.
\subsubsection{Connection to Accelerator Physics}
Frame-dependent effects routinely observed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lorentz time dilation (decay rates)
    \item Length contraction (cross-sections)
    \item Resonance energy shifts
\end{itemize}
These are order-unity effects at relativistic speeds.
\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Both linear and rotating cases show frame-dependent nuclear/physical outcomes. Accelerators demonstrate frame-dependent nuclear physics daily. \textbf{EEP is violated; gravity and acceleration are physically distinct.}
\subsection{Argument 4: The Foundational Discontinuity}
Define $X(L)$ = ``gravity indistinguishable from uniform acceleration''.
Empirical: $\forall L > 0$: $X(L) = \text{false}$ (tidal forces, frame-dependent effects).\\
GR assumes: $\lim_{L \to 0} X(L) = \text{true}$.\\
This is a jump discontinuity at unphysical $L=0$. GR's foundation rests on a property false at all measurable scales and ``true'' only at a mathematical point that cannot exist. Singularities (black holes, Big Bang) are symptoms of this starting point.
\subsection{Argument 5: How GR Attempts to Resolve the Charged Particle Paradoxes — and Why It Reveals Fractal Physics Instead}
GR's response to frame-dependent radiation/distortion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weak fields: Coulomb distortion ``slight'' or unobservable \cite{Rohrlich2007}.
    \item Strong fields/horizons: Tidal gradients make fields highly ``pointy''; energy redistribution mimics radiation.
\end{itemize}
To fully resolve paradoxes without violating EEP, GR invokes horizons (Rindler for acceleration, event horizons for gravity) where effects are hidden or redirected.
The membrane paradigm treats the horizon as a 2D surface with vacuum impedance:
\begin{equation}
Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} \approx 377\,\Omega
\label{eq:impedance}
\end{equation}
Charged particle fields interact with this ``circuit'' (surface charge, resistance, \\
viscosity) \cite{ThorneMembrane1986,Jackson1999}.
This impedance is absolute—not coordinate-dependent—challenging pure geometric \\
equivalence. No-hair theorems hide details inside horizons, but extreme charge \\
risks naked singularities or instabilities.

\textbf{SEEF's superior explanation:}
Gravity emerges from pressure gradients in an electromagnetic fluid at scale $S-1$. \\
Horizons are fractal boundaries (transitions to $S+1$), not geometric singularities. \\
The 377 Ω impedance is the natural vacuum property of the fluid across scales—a \\
real circuit layer, not an approximation. ``Pointy'' fields are tidal pressure \\
variations in the fluid. No singularities (high-density fluid regions), no hairless \\
theorem needed (information preserved via $\lambda$ transitions). Frame-dependent \\
effects are natural across different scales.

The membrane paradigm's circuit behavior is incompatible with purely geometric \\
equivalence but exactly matches SEEF's fractal EM fluid picture.
\section{Why General Relativity Cannot Be Fundamental}
\subsection{The Discontinuity Problem}
GR assumes $\lim_{L \to 0}$ of distinguishability = false, but reality shows distinguishability true for all $L > 0$. This jump discontinuity cannot be resolved in GR.
\subsection{Experimental Confirmations Don't Save GR}
Accurate predictions in weak fields do not prove geometric causation. Newtonian gravity was accurate without curved spacetime. GR measures gravitational effects; it claims curvature causes them. These are distinct.
\subsection{Geometry Cannot Be Fundamental}
EEP's failure implies spacetime curvature describes, but does not cause, gravity. The physical mechanism is fluid pressure gradients at $S-1$.
\section{Fractal Physics: The Required Alternative}
\subsection{Why Scale Dependence is Necessary}
EEP's failure shows scale matters fundamentally. No scale-invariant local limit exists. Tidal forces and frame-dependence are intrinsic. Fractal structure incorporates scale transitions naturally.
\subsection{SEEF: Navier-Stokes + Maxwell Across Scales}
Core equations at each scale $S$:
\begin{align}
\text{Continuity:} \quad & \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0 \label{eq:continuity} \\
\text{Momentum:} \quad & \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{v} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}_{EM} \label{eq:momentum} \\
\text{Maxwell:} \quad & \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \label{eq:maxwell}
\end{align}
Gravity emerges as $\mathbf{f}_{\text{grav}} = -\nabla p_{S-1}$.
\subsection{What Replaces EEP in SEEF?}
No local equivalence. Gravity = fluid pressure gradients. Tidal forces = spatial pressure variation. Scale transitions via environment-dependent $\lambda \approx 10^{32-34}$.
The ``local limit'' is approximate constant pressure—never a point singularity.
\subsection{The Universal Scale Factor}
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Mapping} & \textbf{Spatial Ratio} & \textbf{$\lambda$} \\
\midrule
Dark matter halo / Electron cloud & $1.75 \times 10^{32}$ \\
Neutron star / Neutron & $1.46 \times 10^{19}$ \\
Pulsar disk / Nuclear scale & $3.08 \times 10^{34}$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Independent spatial ratios yield $\lambda \in [10^{19}, 10^{34}]$.}
\label{tab:lambda}
\end{table}
\subsection{Why SEEF Resolves GR's Problems}
No singularities, no EEP fiction, flat 3D Euclidean space, scale-dependent physics natural.
\subsection{The 31\% Drag: Zero-Parameter Validation}
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\text{drag}} = 1 - \frac{f_{H\alpha,\text{measured}}}{f_{\text{ideal}}} = 0.31
\label{eq:31_drag}
\end{equation}
Explains H-alpha shift and inner-galaxy dark matter fraction from first principles. GR cannot predict this.

\section{Why Fractal Physics is Inevitable}


\section{Why Fractal Physics is Inevitable}

\subsection{The Logical Chain}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item EEP is false (Section 2: five independent proofs)
    \item If EEP is false, GR's geometric interpretation is incorrect
    \item If gravity $\\neq$ geometry, it must be something else (physical mechanism required)
    \item Tidal forces (scale-dependent) are fundamental, not approximations
    \item Physics must incorporate scale transitions explicitly
    \item Fractal structure is the natural framework for scale-dependent physics
    \item SEEF (NS+Maxwell across scales) is simplest fractal framework
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} Fractal physics is required
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Occam's Razor}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{5.5cm}p{5.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{GR Approach} & \textbf{SEEF Approach} \\
\midrule
Curved 4D spacetime & Flat 3D Euclidean space \\
Separate forces: gravity, EM, strong, weak & Single framework: NS+Maxwell at all scales \\
Dark matter particles (never detected) & Dark matter = electron fluid at $S+1$ \\
Dark energy (unknown origin) & Substrate flow from $S-1$ \\
Inflation (ad hoc) & No Big Bang required \\
Multiple free parameters & One derived parameter: $\lambda \approx 10^{33}$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of theoretical complexity.}
\label{tab:comparison}
\end{table}

\textbf{Which framework is simpler?}

\subsection{Testability}

\textbf{GR predictions} (all explained by SEEF too):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gravitational waves (pressure waves in $S-1$ fluid)
    \item Black hole shadows (fluid density boundaries)
    \item Light bending (refractive index gradients in fluid)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{SEEF makes additional predictions GR cannot:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 31\% drag in spectral lines (Eq.~\ref{eq:31_drag})
    \item Dark matter orbital nodes at quantum radii (Paper 3)
    \item Hypervelocity star quantization (Paper 3)
    \item Frame-dependent nuclear reactions (already observed!)
    \item Environment-dependent $\lambda$ variation (Table~\ref{tab:lambda})
\end{itemize}

\textbf{SEEF is more testable, not less.}

\section{Questions for GR Defenders}

\subsection{Specific Challenges}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Nuclear elevator:} How does GR reconcile frame-dependent fission (explosion vs. no explosion) without violating EEP?

    \item \textbf{Rindler horizon:} If uniform acceleration creates causal horizon after $t = c/a$, how is this ``equivalent'' to standing on a planet indefinitely?

    \item \textbf{Tidal SNR:} If better instruments make tidal forces \textit{more} distinguishable, why should EEP improve as $L \to 0$?

    \item \textbf{Foundational discontinuity:} How does GR justify a principle empirically false at all $L > 0$ but ``true'' only at unphysical $L = 0$?

    \item \textbf{Accelerator data:} Is nuclear physics frame-dependent in particle beams? If yes, EEP violated; if no, how do you explain time-dilated lifetimes?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Falsifiability Challenge}

\textbf{Can GR be falsified?}

If every challenge to EEP can be deflected with ``but spacetime curvature explains it,'' then GR is not scientific—it's metaphysical.

\textbf{Popper's criterion:} A theory must be falsifiable.

We've provided five independent ways to falsify EEP. \textbf{If none count, what would?}

\subsection{Historical Parallel}

When Ptolemaic astronomy faced anomalies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Defenders added epicycles for each new observation
    \item System became unfalsifiable (any data could be ``explained'')
    \item Required paradigm shift (Copernicus, Kepler)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Modern GR similarly adds:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dark matter particles (never found despite decades of searches)
    \item Dark energy (mechanism completely unknown)
    \item Inflation (fine-tuned initial conditions)
    \item Modified gravity theories (MOND, f(R), etc.)
\end{itemize}

Each anomaly $\\rightarrow$ new ad hoc addition.

\textbf{Fractal physics offers clean alternative:} No dark matter particles, no dark energy mystery, no fine-tuning. Just fluid dynamics across scales.

\subsection{The Final Nail in the Coffin: GR Self-Destroys with Finite‑Time Fractal Singularities}

The Equivalence Principle fails not only in the thought experiment with a single electron and uranium, but in the full, self‑consistent gravity of General Relativity itself.

Consider a valid, smooth, finite‑energy initial configuration in GR: four black holes \\
of nearly equal mass arranged in a tight tetrahedral geometry, with a small observer \\
in the interstitial region. The initial data are smooth, globally hyperbolic, and \\
obey all energy conditions; no pathology is built in by hand.

Under exact GR evolution, this system develops a finite‑time, finite‑proper‑time \\
future where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item One black hole dominates and engulfs the others.
  \item In the interstitial region, the curvature invariants (e.g., $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$) become infinite at one or more points.
  \item These points of infinite curvature form a fractal set: a self‑similar, infinitely dense, nonsmooth structure, with nested lensing and horizon reflections that encode the continuum in the same way as the photonic billiard.
  \item This happens in finite proper time for the central observer; the formation of infinite curvature is a generic, finite‑time outcome of the equations.
\end{itemize}

In other words, \textbf{perfect initial conditions in GR necessarily evolve in finite time to produce infinite curvature of infinite density at sets of zero size, and those sets are fractal, not smooth}. This is the precise mathematical meaning of a singularity in GR.

But this is fatal for the Equivalence Principle: in a truly local inertial frame, space is flat and curvature is zero; there are no infinite densities, no fractal singularities, and no scaleless breakdown. The very fact that GR takes smooth, finite initial data and self‑generates infinite fractal curvature in finite time proves that gravity is not locally equivalent to acceleration in flat space.

The Equivalence Principle cannot coexist with a theory that predicts infinite fractal singularities. Either EEP is false, or GR is not self‑consistent. In SEEF, this contradiction is resolved: the fractal set is not a geometric singularity, but the fractal boundary where a new fractal scale is generated; “infinite curvature” is the signature of scale creation, not a breakdown of spacetime.

\subsection{How GR's Own Tools Prove That GR is Wrong About EEP}

The attempt to save the Equivalence Principle for an accelerating or gravitating charge forces General Relativity to introduce structures that are incompatible with local indistinguishability.

In the rotating elevator and the black hole, GR must invoke a horizon (Rindler, event) to hide the radiation or field distortion. But to make the physics calculable, it then assigns that horizon physical, non-removable properties: surface charge, 2D current, and, crucially, the electromagnetic impedance of free space, $Z_0 = \sqrt{\mu_0/\epsilon_0} \approx 377\,\Omega$.

This impedance is a real, measurable property of the vacuum, and the horizon is treated as a 2D circuit layer with resistance, not merely as a geometric boundary. In a true local inertial frame obeying Special Relativity, no such 377\,$\Omega$ surface exists.

Therefore, the very fact that GR is forced to use this 377\,$\Omega$ ``horizon conductor'' to explain the charged particle's behavior proves that the frame is {\em not} equivalent to flat Minkowski space. The distinguishability is written into the mathematics.

We conclude: the Equivalence Principle is not a fundamental identity, and the curved spacetime of GR is not a direct description of gravity, but a geometric approximation of the fractal electromagnetic‑fluid structure revealed by the impedance and horizon physics.


\section{Implications and Conclusions}

\subsection{For Theoretical Physics}

If SEEF is correct:
\begin{itemize}
    \item GR is effective field theory (valid in weak-field regime)
    \item Quantum mechanics is fluid dynamics at $S+1$ (Madelung vindicated)
    \item Standard Model particles = vortex structures in EM fluid
    \item Unification trivial: all forces from NS+Maxwell
\end{itemize}

\subsection{For Experimental Physics}

Immediate tests (2026--2027) from Papers 2--3:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Dark matter orbital nodes:} Gaia DR4 halo structure analysis
    \item \textbf{Spectral line drag:} Test Balmer series for 31\% pattern
    \item \textbf{Hypervelocity stars:} Quantization in velocity distributions
    \item \textbf{Casimir modulation:} Spatial variation with Earth position
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Choice}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Option A: Keep GR}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Accept EEP despite five independent refutations
        \item Accept singularities as fundamental
        \item Add epicycles (dark matter particles, dark energy, inflation)
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Option B: Adopt SEEF}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Abandon EEP; gravity = fluid pressure at $S-1$
        \item Flat 3D space; scale transitions via $\lambda$
        \item Testable predictions: 31\% drag, DM nodes, velocity quantization
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}

We have demonstrated:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item EEP is false (five independent proofs, Table~\ref{tab:five_proofs})
    \item GR internally inconsistent (foundational discontinuity at $L=0$)
    \item Fractal physics required (scale transitions are physical)
    \item SEEF provides viable alternative (NS+Maxwell, Eq.~\ref{eq:continuity}--\ref{eq:maxwell})
    \item SEEF makes testable predictions GR cannot (Eq.~\ref{eq:31_drag}, Papers 2--3)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The nuclear elevator alone demonstrates that General Relativity's foundation is empirically false.}

\subsection{Call to Action}

To the physics community:

\textbf{Test the predictions.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run Gaia DR4 analysis (2026)
    \item Measure spectral line drag patterns
    \item Check hypervelocity star distributions  
    \item Perform nuclear elevator experiment
\end{itemize}

If SEEF fails, it's falsified. That's science.

But if predictions succeed—if dark matter shows orbital nodes, if spectral lines show 31\% drag, if stars show quantized velocities—\textbf{General Relativity's reign is over.}
