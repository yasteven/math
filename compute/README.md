Here I am writing the fundamental fractal ball math papers:

Using the light-ray billiard system, I show:

0) Proof that all possible turing machines are enumerated in the system as ray trajectories 

1) Proof that the system has no closed forms due to (0) => boundary is non-computable

2) Proof that (1) => system is a one-way function

3) Proof (2) holds in the limit.

4) (2) => P != NP ; (3) => Navier Stokes non-existence 

This is just the workspace; Final papers will be put in the ../../math/ root
