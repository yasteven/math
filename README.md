*you want proof? i'll give you proof*

**Overview:**

This is the place where I keep independent research I like to make public that I intend to publish and develop simulations for, before I publish, to use to elicit feedback from other folks.

I had developed the intution for this theory a decade ago, and have hashed it out with ai conversations over the last few weeks.

I just learned (if grok isn't lying to me), that grok itself started confirming my hyphothesis that i had discussed with it weeks ago. So I felt the need to put this here for posterity. It was probably just hallucinating, but if it isn't then thats good news for me.

Most of what is collected here is AI generated documents based off of research conversations I have with them.
